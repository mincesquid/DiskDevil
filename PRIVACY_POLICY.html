        <h1>Privacy Policy for DiskDevil</h1>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 9, 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            DiskDevil ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how DiskDevil collects, uses, and safeguards your information
            when you use our macOS application.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>DiskDevil is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal information:</p>

        <h3>1. Local System Data (Stays on Your Device)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File System Analysis:</strong> DiskDevil scans your Mac's file system to identify hidden files, large files, duplicate files, and potential security issues. This data is processed locally and never transmitted off your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Scan Results:</strong> Information about system vulnerabilities, firewall status, Gatekeeper status, and System Integrity Protection status is collected for display but remains on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Connections:</strong> When you use the Network Monitor feature, DiskDevil logs active network connections on your Mac. This information stays local and is not transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Settings:</strong> Your selected privacy level (1-10) and custom privacy configurations are stored locally in your Mac's preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Subscription & Purchase Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple Subscription Data:</strong> Subscription management is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We receive anonymized transaction receipts to verify your subscription status (Free, Premium, or Elite tier).</li>
            <li><strong>No Payment Data:</strong> DiskDevil never sees or stores your payment information. All transactions are processed by Apple.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Optional Analytics (Opt-In Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> If you choose to enable analytics in Settings, we may collect anonymized data about:
                <ul>
                    <li>Which features you use (e.g., Security Scanner, Cleanup, Privacy Slider)</li>
                    <li>How often you use each feature</li>
                    <li>Crash reports and error logs (anonymized)</li>
                    <li>macOS version and hardware specifications (no serial numbers or identifiers)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
